# 1. Formation of the Hosting Networking Group

Date: 2025-10-17

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

We have different hosting platforms, the wider MoJ network and various 3rd parties which need network connectivity to each other and rely on shared services such as DNS.  No one team has ownership, skills, knowledge and people to complete all the activities required around this.  Currently these tasks are mainly completed on a good will basis, borrowing expertise where needed or doing tasks alongside their day job. 

## Decision

We will create a Hosting Networking Group (HNWG), this will pull together people with networking skill sets from various teams in hosting and the wider MoJ networking community. 

Here we can share ideas, standards, and take responsibility of critical networking resources from individuals and manage them as a group.   

We can give advice and guidance for teams to help them complete networking tasks themselves or find people from within the group with the skills required and liaise with their current teams to agree their time to work on the task. 

We will take on ownership of networking services which are currently without owners such as DNS.
