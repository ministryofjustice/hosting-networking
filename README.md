Documentation and issues relating to networking in and around the MoJ strategic hosting platforms.

## Purpose

The hosting-networking group works in the open to meet and resolve networking requirements that span the hosting space
and involve multiple stakeholders. By working as a group we reduce the reliance on individuals to drive
technical solutions. We work in as open a fashion as practical to ensure our solutions are of high-quality and that they
are both visible and meet the needs of our stakeholders.

## Areas of interest
